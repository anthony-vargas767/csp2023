    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hello I am a student named Anthony Vargas, and I go to a school called Santa ana high school as a senior. Here is a recent photo of me.</p>

    <p>I have not taken any PLTW or technology classes in my past nor have I gotten any reward in those subjects.</p>
    <p>The reason I am taking this course is that I wanted to pick up  coding as a skill for fun and to also be able to make videogames, I tired a little bit of coding in a game called Roblox where you can code things into it's system and make differents types of games you want which I made one for me and my friends to play.</p>
    <p>Some things I like to do are to read, go to the gym, go outside and love nature, swim, drawing, and to hangout with friends.The books I love to read are called mangas which are Japanese graphic novels.To name a few which I loved to read are The Climber, Berserk, Vagabond</p>
